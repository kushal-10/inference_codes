	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a locker room. It is designed for individuals to store personal belongings, likely in a communal setting such as a school, gym, or sports facility. The blue lockers are the main feature of the room, and they are arranged in a way that maximizes the available space. The presence of a mirror suggests that this area may also be used for personal grooming or checking one's appearance before or after physical activity. The wooden bench provides a place to sit, possibly for putting on or taking off shoes or resting. The scale indicates that the room is also used for monitoring one's weight, which is common in fitness and health-related environments. Given the layout and the items present, the room serves multiple purposes: storage, grooming, and health monitoring. To proceed with the task, we need to determine the next room to visit. Since there is no indication of other rooms from the current perspective, and considering the goal is to visit all rooms with the fewest number of changes, we should proceed to the room accessible through the door in the background. Therefore, the next instruction is: "GO: through the door in the background."
