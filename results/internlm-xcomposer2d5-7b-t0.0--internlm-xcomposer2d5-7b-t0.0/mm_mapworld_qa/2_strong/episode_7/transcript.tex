	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a bathroom, specifically a men's restroom based on the design and fixtures. It is designed for functionality and comfort, with multiple sinks indicating it is likely a public or semi-public space such as a hotel, office building, or upscale restaurant. The arrangement of the sinks in a row suggests an efficient use of space, allowing multiple users to access the facilities simultaneously. The presence of decorative elements like flowers and framed pictures adds a touch of elegance and warmth to the otherwise utilitarian environment. Given the options of east, north, and west, and considering the layout of the room, the most logical direction to explore next would be east, as it might lead to another section of the bathroom or an adjoining room. Therefore, the next instruction would be:\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a men's restroom with multiple sinks and decorative elements.", "action": "GO: east"}
