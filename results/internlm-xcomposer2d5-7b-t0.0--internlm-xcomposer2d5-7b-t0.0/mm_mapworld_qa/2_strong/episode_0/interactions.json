It is designed with a neutral color palette, primarily featuring shades of beige and brown, which gives it a warm and inviting atmosphere. The room is well-lit, with natural light streaming in from the large windows, complemented by the soft glow of the lamps. The furniture is arranged to create a cozy seating area, perfect for relaxation or socializing. From this vantage point, we have the option to move towards the kitchen to the south or towards the dining area to the east. Considering the layout, it seems more practical to head towards the kitchen first.
