	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a bathroom, specifically a shower room. It is designed with beige and brown tiles, giving it a warm and earthy feel. The shower area is equipped with multiple showerheads, and the water is cascading down, indicating that the shower is in use. To the left of the shower, there is a towel hanging neatly on a rack, ready for use after the shower. On the right side of the shower, there appears to be a control panel or some sort of mechanism, possibly for adjusting the water temperature or starting/stopping the shower. There are no other visible exits or entrances from this room, so it seems we have reached a dead end in our exploration. Therefore, the next instruction would be to stop the exploration as there are no new rooms to visit. \\ \tt {"description": "We are in a bathroom with a shower and towel.", "action": "DONE"}
