        <p>We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: &quot;{&quot;description&quot;: &quot;&lt;room description&gt;&quot;, &quot;action&quot;: &quot;&lt;action&gt;&quot;}&quot;. Replace &lt;room description&gt; with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;GO: DIRECTION&quot; where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace &lt;action&gt; with &quot;DONE&quot;. Omit any other text.<br/>Here is an example:<br/>We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west.

        <p>The room we are currently in is a bedroom with an unmade bed, a lamp on the bedside table, and a pile of clothes on a chair. There is also a window with closed curtains and a suitcase on the floor. Given the current state of the room and the lack of other visible exits or rooms, it seems we have explored all available spaces. Therefore, the appropriate action to take would be to conclude our exploration and confirm that we are done. The next instruction should be:<br/>```json<br/>{<br/>  &quot;description&quot;: &quot;We are in a bedroom with an unmade bed, a lamp on the bedside table, a pile of clothes on a chair, a window with closed curtains, and a suitcase on the floor.
