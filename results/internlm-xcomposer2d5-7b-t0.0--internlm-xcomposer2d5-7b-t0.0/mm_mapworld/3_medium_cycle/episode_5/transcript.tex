	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the image provided, we are in a room that appears to be a living area or a study. The room is characterized by a large window that offers a view of the outdoors, a comfortable-looking armchair, a small table with a plant, and a bookshelf filled with books. The room is bathed in natural light, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. The presence of the armchair and the bookshelf suggests that this space is used for relaxation or reading. To proceed with the task, we need to determine the next room to visit and the direction to take. Since there are no other rooms visible in the image, we can conclude that we have reached the final room. Therefore, the next instruction would be to stop the exploration and confirm that we are done. The answer in the required format would be:\\ \tt ```json\\ \tt {\\ \tt   "description": "We are in a room with a large window, an armchair, a small table with a plant, and a bookshelf filled with books.
