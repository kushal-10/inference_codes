	 We are currently in this room. Please help me with the following task. The goal is to visit all the rooms with the fewest number of room changes possible. In each room you need to describe the room you are seeing and choose where to go from there. Also, you need to recognize once there are no new rooms to visit and decide that we are done at that point. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". Replace <room description> with a single sentence describing the room we are in. To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. To stop the exploration, replace <action> with "DONE". Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt We are in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 The room we are currently in is a recreational room, specifically designed for playing tabletop games and billiards. It contains a foosball table in the foreground, which is the main focus of the image. In the background, there is a billiards table with a green playing surface. The room is equipped with fluorescent lighting and has an exit sign indicating the direction to the exit. The walls are adorned with various posters and notices, adding a casual and communal atmosphere to the space. Based on the available information and the current state of the room, it seems that we have explored all the rooms that are accessible from this point. Therefore, the next instruction would be to conclude our exploration and confirm that we are done. Here is the answer in the required format:\\ \tt ```json\\ \tt {\\ \tt   "description": "We are in a recreational room with a foosball table and a billiards table in the background, surrounded by posters and notices on the walls. The room has an exit sign and fluorescent lighting. We have explored all accessible rooms from this point and there are no new rooms to visit.",\\ \tt   "action": "DONE"\\ \tt }\\ \tt ```
