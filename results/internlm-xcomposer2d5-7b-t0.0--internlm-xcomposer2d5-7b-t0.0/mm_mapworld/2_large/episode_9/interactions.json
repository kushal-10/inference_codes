It features a bunk bed with a ladder on the right side, allowing access to the upper bunk. Below the bunk bed, there is a single mattress on the floor, providing an alternative sleeping arrangement. On the left side of the room, there is a small sink with a mirror above it, suggesting a space for washing hands or face. The room's walls are covered in light wood paneling, and the color scheme is neutral, with whites and light browns dominating the space. There are no decorations or personal items visible, giving the room a minimalist and utilitarian appearance. Based on the available information, it seems that there are no other rooms to visit from this location.
