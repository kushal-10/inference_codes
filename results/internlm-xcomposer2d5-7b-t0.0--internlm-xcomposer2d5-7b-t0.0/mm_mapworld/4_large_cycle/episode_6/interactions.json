It is characterized by wooden shelving units filled with an assortment of wine bottles. The shelving extends from the floor to the ceiling, creating a multi-tiered storage system. The room has a rustic charm, enhanced by the use of wood and the warm lighting that casts a soft glow on the wine bottles. In the center of the room, there is a wooden barrel, which adds to the traditional ambiance of the space. To proceed, we can either head north or south, as there are no other visible exits or rooms from this vantage point.
