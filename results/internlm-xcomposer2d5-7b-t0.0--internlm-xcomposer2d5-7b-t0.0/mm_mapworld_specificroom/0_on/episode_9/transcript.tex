	 Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room. In each room I will show you an image of the room and tell you in what directions we can go from there. You then give me a description of the room you see in exactly one sentence. Please give your answer in the following format: "{"description": "<room description>", "action": "<action>"}". To move to a neighboring room, replace <action> with "GO: DIRECTION" where DIRECTION can be one of [north, south, east, west]. Most importantly, once we have found the target room, replace <action> with "DONE" instead. Omit any other text.\\ \tt Here is an example:\\ \tt The target room is a bathroom.\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: north, west. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a kitchen with a red fridge.", "action": "GO: north"}\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room. From here we can go: south, east. What is your next instruction?\\ \tt {"description": "We are in a living room with a couch and a tv.", "action": "GO: east"}\\ \tt ...\\ \tt We have made a step and are now in this room.

	 Based on the provided image and the context of the task, we are currently in a garden-like setting, which is the starting point for our exploration. Since the target room is a yard, and we are already in what appears to be an outdoor garden area, we can conclude that we have reached the target room. Therefore, the next instruction would be to indicate that the target has been found, and no further movement is necessary. The format for this would be:\\ \tt \\ \tt ```json\\ \tt {\\ \tt   "description": "We are in a garden with a stone pathway and plants, which is the target yard area. It is surrounded by a white fence and has a serene atmosphere with sunlight filtering through the foliage. The garden is well-maintained with a variety of greenery and flowers, creating a tranquil outdoor space. The presence of a stone turtle adds a whimsical touch to the setting. The target room, the yard, has been reached. No further action is needed as we have arrived at our destination."\\ \tt   "action": "DONE"\\ \tt }\\ \tt ```
