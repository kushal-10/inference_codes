        <p>Please help me with the following task. The goal is to explore rooms and find target room.

        <p>Based on the provided image and the context of the task, the description of the room we are currently in would be: &quot;We are in an outdoor backyard area with a wooden staircase leading to a door, surrounded by a wooden fence and residential buildings.&quot; As for the next instruction, since the target room is a waiting room and we are currently in an outdoor backyard, we need to find a way to enter the building. Therefore, the next instruction would be to &quot;GO: east&quot; towards the visible door, which presumably leads to the interior of the building where the waiting room might be located.</p>
